# 1. Introduction

The OSI Challenger 1P (Superboard II) is an early 1970s–80s 6502-based single-board microcomputer.  
This manual documents two major components:

1. The real OSI C1P hardware  
2. The PCjs C1P emulator hosted at `https://rgjohn.github.io/`

The goal is to create a stable, well-understood software development environment for 6502 machine code using:

- A custom-enhanced PCjs emulator  
- Hex loaders compatible with real C1P hardware  
- Development automation tools  
- VRAM/screen extraction  
- Direct machine-code injection capabilities  

This reference manual will evolve continuously as new features are added.
